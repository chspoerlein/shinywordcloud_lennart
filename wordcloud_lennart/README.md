## Description

This directory contains code for a shiny app plotting word clouds of my first son. It includes all relevant data and scripts to plot word clouds in German and the way he pronounces the words, his total word count for each month starting in September 2017 until age 2 (September 2018). Moreover, users are able to search for specific words and get information on words' first occurance. And finally, the "Bilder" tab contains images of Lennart taken at the specified time period.

Enjoy!
